        As a speaker it's a struggle to find all the CFPs that are out there. When you get notified about an awesome
        event, it's usually too late and the CFP is already closed! üëé

        originally created this website. Currently the website is being run, managed and maintained
        by <a href="https://www.rickvandenbosch.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Rick van den Bosch</a>.
        With this application we would like to provide you with a portal that allows you to submit any CFP to any
        event, but maybe even more important: enable you to find open CFPs to awesome events! WHOA! ü§Ø

        If you have reached this website right now, be prepared for some rough edges. We're busy completely
        rebuilding it, most of the stuff should work but you can run into some unfinished features or bugs.
        Don't let that stop you though! But in the meanwhile please don't hesitate to let me know what you
        think and reach out to me at rickvdbosch@outlook.com or Twitter: @@rickvdbosch.
